# GNNTAL
Repository of the paper "Identifying Critical Nodes in Complex Networks Using GraphSAGE and Transformer" by H. Wang, T. Luo and et al.
# Overview
The repository contains the codes and data for the "Identifying Critical Nodes in Complex Networks Using GraphSAGE and Transformer".
# Data
We provide the data and labels for the 12 real networks we used. SIRLabels contains the corresponding labels, and Realnetwork contains the edge lists of the real networks. 
# Code
We provide the code for the GNNT model, GNNTAL model, and GNNTAL-DS in the IMP problem. The Model.py contains the code for the GNNT model, Train_Model.py contains the code for training the GNNT model, ActiveLearning.py contains the code for fine-tuning the model to produce the GNNTAL model, and Select_seed_nodes_diversity.py contains the code for our GNNTAL-DS seed selection strategy.
# Issues
If you find a problem with the implementation code, please contact us.
